# Random_story_python
a micro game - random story making in Python
When I was a kid, we used to play this game using paper and pen. Several players, by turn, give random answers to some basic questions, the paper is folded after each answer so that the next player cannot see what was written before him. In the end, the paper is unfolded and a crazy story can be read :)
So I sort of recreated that game using Python :)
